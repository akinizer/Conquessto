=== IN-PROGRESS ===
* Mechanics
Terrashift: it has multiple forms and a base form
Shortest Path Algorithm: Collided Units
Game Setup: Functionality
Battle Currency: 
    Counts Toward Global Currency: Nutritions, Metal
Rewards:
    Nutritions, Metal gained during battles (giftboxes, npc in a random civlian structure)
    Global currencies, achievements, scores, points as battlefield win / loss rewards
    Multiplier: 1.1 to 1.8 (enemy quantity)
    Larger map = more encounters 
Restrictions:
    No enemy building capture, they can be infiltrated by Doubleagent and have to be destroyed
    Resources have to farmed in field
    If human player is defeated, it is a loss. If all enemies are defeated it is a win
    Global currencies gained during battles are guaranteed acquisition
    Battle end rewards are based on success criteria, number of enemies defeated x win / loss multiplier (1, 0.3) and activities during battles
    Max energy, buildings and units cost battle currencies
    Terrain based movement speed and limitations: water areas, passages, choke points, bumps
    Map layout based restrictions: trees, bridges, civilian structures and more
    Map types: team lands, city, desert, mars 
    Fog of war, line of sight (probably at end of plan)
    Buildings can be placed near HQ building, forward base or a captured territory building

=============BUGFIX-PLAN=======================

*PRIORITY:

- collision distance unit vs building
- pathfinding unit vs solid
- pathfinding unit vs terrain
- move to attack should override click to move


*GameController.js

### **Flawed Selection Logic**
- **Function:** `_selectObject`
- **Code Part:** This bug is found in the large `if (!isSameProductionBuilding)` block at the beginning. This logic is designed to deselect all objects before selecting a new one, which prevents multi-selection.

---

### **Collision Logic Mismatch**
- **Function:** `isLocationClear`
- **Code Part:** The bug is within the `if (otherObj.tags.includes('structure'))` block. The code inside this section uses circle-to-rectangle and circle-to-circle collision checks, which is inconsistent with how your game objects are defined as rectangles.

---

### **Redundant Code**
- **Function:** `handleMouseDown`
- **Code Part:** This function is redundant because it simply calls another function, `onCanvasClick`. The logic for a left-click should be moved directly into `handleMouseDown`.

- **Function:** `handleMouseMove`
- **Code Part:** The entire `handleMouseMove` function is a duplicate of `onCanvasMouseMove` and is never called by any event listener, making it dead code.

* Unit Mechanics

attack move -> override move
attack move - dynamic tracking
attack move - set dynamic waypoint flag

move - set waypoint flag

move waypoint: click to move, click to attack, click to Garrison
autotarget range, autochase range 
set multipath: shift right click to set paths and on release move unit
override movement: right click to move disables autochase and autoattack until it ends paths

multi select on double click
drag select

smart movement: ai behavior, blocked path - reroute, dont move beyond map canvas edge
smart attack: attack priority, ignore or hit obstacle on ranged attack

force attack - friend fire: ctrl + right click on friend unit or building
force attack - ground
force attack - natural

attack to building
return to position
march: move A - B until autochase

* Building Mechanics
HP, Destruction-Elimination

Offensive Buildings: Turrets, Traps, Aura Buildings

* Map Mechanics
fog of war (cloud, gray)
map zoom

* SFX
building select, building production
unit select, unit move, unit attack, unit shoot unit destruction
produce panel:ready, hold on, cancel, click, cant click

victory, game over

* Indicators
enemy pointer arrow
cursor location X,Y
objectives panel: kill enemies, destroy bases, generate resources (credits, metal), survive for a duration
battlefield details: enemy names (crossed over when dead), number of units, enemy colors
